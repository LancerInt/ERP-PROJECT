# Change Enablement Playbook

This playbook provides a detailed procedure to manage communication, training, and adoption activities throughout the Zoho Creator ERP rollout.

## Step 1: Establish Change Governance
1. Office Manager appoints a Change Lead (HR Coordinator at Office) and forms a Change Council comprising module owners (Purchase, Sales, Production, Finance, QC, Warehouse HR, IT Admin).
2. Define change objectives, success metrics (user adoption, reduction in manual trackers), and reporting cadence.
3. Create a stakeholder impact map identifying personas, expected process shifts, and risk level (high/medium/low).
4. Align change governance with the Phase 0 steering committee and document decision rights.

## Step 2: Develop Communication Strategy
1. Draft key messages tailored to each stakeholder group (Head Office leadership, warehouse teams, QC, finance, HR) outlining benefits, timelines, and support channels.
2. Build a communication calendar with channel mix (email, town halls, WhatsApp updates, Creator in-app banners) aligned to milestones.
3. Prepare FAQs and myth-busters to address anticipated resistance (e.g., concerns about attendance photo capture, freight automation).
4. Set up feedback loops (survey forms, suggestion inbox) and assign owners to monitor responses.

## Step 3: Prepare Training Assets
1. Identify training modules per role (Purchase workflow, Sales order management, Production batch recording, Finance reconciliation, Attendance capture).
2. Develop learning materials: slide decks, short videos, Creator sandbox exercises, and quick reference guides (QRGs).
3. Map training delivery modes—virtual for HO roles, on-site for warehouse teams, blended for QC and logistics.
4. Validate training content with module owners to ensure process accuracy and compliance messaging (e.g., GST handling, wage approvals).

## Step 4: Execute Stakeholder Readiness Assessments
1. Conduct baseline readiness surveys to gauge familiarity with current vs future processes.
2. Analyse survey results to prioritise high-risk groups requiring deeper engagement or additional training.
3. Schedule targeted workshops or office hours based on readiness findings.
4. Update the change risk log with mitigation actions and responsible owners.

## Step 5: Deliver Training & Enablement
1. Roll out training sessions in alignment with phased go-live (e.g., Purchase first, then Sales/Production).
2. Capture attendance and assessment scores to ensure competency across roles.
3. Provide on-demand resources via a central knowledge base (Zoho WorkDrive) with version control.
4. Deploy floor walkers or super-users during go-live weeks for hands-on support at warehouses and HO.

## Step 6: Support Go-Live Communication & Reinforcement
1. Issue go-live countdown communications highlighting cutover steps, blackout windows, and support contacts.
2. Publish daily go-live status updates during the first two weeks, including resolved issues and upcoming fixes.
3. Recognise early adopters and teams achieving milestones to reinforce positive behaviour.
4. Maintain change dashboards tracking adoption metrics (usage stats, ticket volumes, approval turnaround) and share with leadership.

## Step 7: Post-Go-Live Stabilisation
1. Gather user feedback through surveys and retrospectives at the end of each phase; log enhancement requests.
2. Prioritise quick wins for upcoming sprints and communicate delivery timelines.
3. Update training content and QRGs based on real-world learnings and system tweaks.
4. Transition hypercare support responsibilities from project team to BAU support desk with documented SOPs.

## Step 8: Sustain Continuous Improvement
1. Schedule quarterly change reviews to assess adoption metrics, new process introductions, and expansion plans (new warehouses, modules).
2. Integrate change impact assessment into the Change Enablement intake process for future enhancements.
3. Maintain an up-to-date change roadmap aligned with integration and security initiatives.
4. Celebrate success stories and share cross-warehouse best practices to keep momentum high.
