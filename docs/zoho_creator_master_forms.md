## 5. Implementation Checklist

Use this quick checklist when creating masters inside Zoho Creator:

1. **Seed System Parameters** – currencies, UOMs, state lists, alert thresholds.
2. **Create Companies** – load all legal entities and validate GSTIN/PAN formats.
3. **Onboard Warehouses** – ensure godown and machinery subforms are populated.
4. **Define Roles** – capture approval levels and share rules before user mapping.
5. **Load Staff & Stakeholders** – upload staff roster, then link portal users.
6. **Configure Shifts** – assign default shifts for attendance automation.
7. **Catalogue Products & Services** – include conversion factors and QC flags.
8. **Load Vendors, Customers, Transporters** – verify payment and freight terms.
9. **Publish Price Lists** – map to customers and shipping locations as needed.
10. **Upload Template/QC Libraries** – align with production and QC processes.
11. **Set Tax Rates** – GST, TDS, TCS for transactions and wage calculations.
12. **Record Decisions & Audit Hooks** – keep governance log current.

Completing these forms ensures every downstream workflow (purchase requests,
production batches, freight advice, wage approvals, etc.) has valid reference
data and can enforce the governance model described in the broader ERP blueprint.
