# Zoho Creator ERP Blueprint

## 1. Solution Overview

This blueprint translates the ERP vision into a Zoho Creator application suite that supports multi-company, multi-warehouse operations governed from a Head Office (HO). The design emphasises role-based security, modular workflows, configurable master data, and extensibility for future warehouses, products, and services. The artefact is structured for Creator builders and process owners to collaborate on implementation details, identify dependencies, and phase the rollout.

- **[ERD Library](./zoho_creator_erds.md)** – conceptual entity-relationship diagrams per domain.

### 1.1 Design Principles
- **Single tenant, multi-entity**: One Creator application where companies and warehouses are linked to a central Head Office, yet each warehouse works autonomously for stock, production, and attendance.
- **Role-centric security**: Stakeholders act in multiple roles; permissions inherit from role assignments with scoped data sharing rules per warehouse/company.
- **Template-driven operations**: Purchase, Sales, Production, QC, and Job Work leverage configurable templates with revision history (Rev 1, Rev 2, …) and audit trails.
- **Document-first interactions**: Every external transaction captures the source document (PO, invoice, weighment slip) as file uploads tied to structured metadata.
- **Workflow automation**: Approval routing, notifications, escalations, and conditional branching follow Deluge workflow rules.
- **Financial compliance**: GST/TDS/TCS tracking, ledger integrity, bank reconciliation, and lockable fiscal periods follow Indian statutory needs.
- **Extensibility**: IT Admin owns master data maintenance, including products, services, price lists, templates, tax masters, and freight matrices.
- **Multi-device experience**: Key pages are optimised for both desktop (HO back office) and mobile (warehouse floor teams) interfaces within Zoho Creator.

### 1.2 Application Structure
- **App Groups**: Separate Creator pages/workflows by module (Purchase, Sales, Production, QC, Inventory, Finance, Attendance, Logistics).
- **Shared Masters**: Centralised forms (Company, Warehouse, Stakeholder Roles, Products, Services, Vendors, Customers, Transporters, Tax, Freight Terms, Templates, Machines, Employees/Staff).
- **Integrations**: External services include Zoho Sign-in (portal users), AI-powered PO parser (OpenAI API), face recognition (OpenAI API), Tally exports, bank statement parsers.
- **Admin Console**: Custom page for IT Admin to maintain branding (logos/templates), system parameters, service categories, approval delegations, and automation thresholds.

## 4. Module Workflows & Automations

### 4.1 Purchase Workflow Summary
1. **Demand Capture**: Warehouse Manager/Coordinator submits PR with product lines and attachments. Creator workflow ensures only warehouse roles can view.
2. **Approval**: Warehouse Coordinator at Office / Purchase roles approve/reject/partial approve. Partial approvals recorded per line.
3. **RFQ Generation**: Purchase Coordinator triggers RFQ, selects vendors, attaches specifications/photos. Option to bypass RFQ (requires Purchase Manager approval flag).
4. **Quote Handling**: Vendors respond via portal/email; data captured in Quote Response form. Quote Evaluation page compares responses, stores justification, and logs approvals.
5. **PO Creation**: Approved quote converts to PO. System supports revisions (Rev 1, Rev 2) with change log. PO can link to multiple PRs and single/multiple RFQs.
6. **Arrival ETA Tracking**: Between PO and Receipt, Warehouse Coordinator at Office or Purchase Coordinator updates anticipated arrival dates; workflow maintains history.
7. **Receipt Advice**: Upon arrival, Warehouse Coordinator scans vendor invoice (OCR optional), selects PO lines, records received qty, batch, godown, packing materials, freight terms, loading/unloading, discounts. Partial receipts update PO status to Partially Received.
8. **QC Integration**: If QC required (per product), QC request auto-created and assigned to appropriate role.
9. **Stock Update**: Passing QC adds goods to stock. Failing QC triggers notifications to Office Manager, Purchase Manager, Purchase Coordinator; credit note workflow available.
10. **Freight Advice**: Based on freight terms (Paid/To_Pay/Mixed) and recorded actuals, Freight Coordinator drafts advice; Finance Manager approves. Supports instalments, TDS, discounts, and issues automatic payment reminders on each scheduled due date.
11. **Payment Advice**: Payment terms drive due dates and ageing reports. Finance Manager generates advice post-QC approval; Office Manager final authorises. Bank statement uploads auto-match payments and mark invoices settled.
12. **Reporting**: Pending PO report, Ageing payables, Vendor performance, GST/TDS/TCS summaries.

### 4.2 Sales Workflow Summary
1. **Customer PO Intake**: Sales Coordinator uploads PO PDF in Customer PO Upload form. AI parser (custom function) extracts data; manual review resolves low confidence fields.
2. **Draft SO**: Creator function maps PO line items to price list entries based on delivery location. Missing products trigger prompt to add to price list (Sales Manager action).
3. **Approval & Assignment**: Sales Manager/Coordinator approves SO, assigns warehouse. Credit terms validated (overdue triggers warnings to Sales & Finance). Record auto-shared with assigned warehouse roles.
4. **Dispatch Planning**: Sales Coordinator/Warehouse Manager create DCs. Each DC can pull lines from multiple SOs and specify multiple delivery locations. Transport details captured with master data reference.
5. **Freight Advice**: Outbound Freight Advice generated similarly to inbound. Supports partial payments, instalments, TDS, and scheduled due-date reminders for outstanding freight instalments.
6. **Invoice Processing**: Once DC executed, internal invoice record created. Statutory invoice PDF uploaded; system compares line totals vs SO to detect variance. Office Manager/Sales Manager review and accept with remarks if overriding values.
7. **Inventory Deduction**: On invoice acceptance, inventory deducted (per batch/godown). Payment terms update receivables ledger and trigger auto-reminders for overdue (> credit terms + 2 weeks).
8. **Reconciliation Report**: Dashboard connecting Customer PO → SO → DC → Invoice → Payment with colour-coded status, anomalies flagged.

### 4.3 Production Workflow Summary
1. **BOM Forecast**: Warehouse Coordinator selects production template and output qty. System calculates required RM/PM, compares with stock, identifies purchase needs, exports Excel for planning.
2. **BOM Approval**: Warehouse Manager approves BOM request. Shortfall lines can auto-create PR drafts.
3. **Work Order Creation**: Batch ID auto-generated (per warehouse prefix + running number). Template revision captured; yield expectations recorded.
4. **Material Issue**: Warehouse Coordinator issues materials; system reserves packing materials automatically for Work Order.
5. **Production Stages**: Forms capture stage updates (Issue, Mixing/Fermentation, Packing, QC/COA release). Stage transitions recorded with timestamps and responsible users.
6. **QC & Rework**: If QC fails, QC Coordinator/Manager can request reformulation—system creates new batch (suffix) or reopens with Rework status. Traceability maintained.
7. **Wage Calculation**: Template-based wages auto-populate voucher drafts. Headcount-based wages require tasks/time logging; Warehouse Manager justifies tasks. Warehouse Coordinator at Office reviews, Finance Manager approves.
8. **Yield Reporting**: Compare expected vs actual yield, purity, AI content; daily/batch dashboards available.
9. **Integration**: Production completion triggers inventory additions, wage voucher creation, QC report linking.

### 4.4 Finance Workflow Summary
- **Vendor Payments**: Payment advice from Purchase; 2-step approval (Finance Manager → Office Manager). Bank statement reconciliation runs off daily uploads to auto-match transactions and flag unmatched items.
- **Customer Receipts**: Payment receipt records created via bank upload or manual entry. Overdue receivables trigger notifications and escalate if >2 weeks overdue.
- **Freight/Wage Ledgers**: Separate ledgers per transporter and contractor, capturing TDS, instalments, partial payments.
- **GST/TDS/TCS**: Tax master maintains rates; each transaction calculates taxes separately from product price. GST reconciliation report compares tax liability vs credits per company.
- **Petty Cash**: Finance issues petty cash vouchers to warehouse coordinator; coordinator records cash settlements; weekly statements auto-generated and shared.
- **Period Locking**: Post monthly reconciliation, Finance locks ledger month to prevent edits; unlock requires justification and audit trail.

### 4.5 Logistics Modules
- **Stock Transfer**: Initiated by sending warehouse. DC marks goods In Transit. Freight/loading/unloading vouchers generated and routed for approvals. Receiving warehouse posts receipt advice; only then inventory moves from In Transit to Available.
- **Inter-Warehouse Shifting**: Within same warehouse, reason codes recorded; freight/loading/unloading vouchers created with approvals. In-transit tracking and reason analytics included.

### 4.6 Job Work Workflow Summary
1. **Job Work Template**: Defines required inputs, expected outputs, QC requirements, turnaround time, TDS applicability.
2. **Order & Dispatch**: Warehouse Coordinator raises Job Work Order, issues materials/machines via Job Work DC. Freight recorded separately for both directions.
3. **Receipt & QC**: Partial receipts allowed; QC performed as per template. Job work outputs receive new batch IDs.
4. **Charges & Payments**: Job Work Charge Voucher calculates service fee, TDS, freight charges. Approval path similar to vendor payments. Alerts if DC remains open beyond threshold.
5. **Machine Tracking**: Machine or spare sent to vendor tracked until returned; service completion logged.

### 4.7 Sales Return Workflow Summary
- **Return Advice**: Warehouse records returned goods with photos, reasons. Approval chain: Sales Manager/Office Manager → Finance Manager (for debit note/stock authorisation).
- **QC Decision**: QC marks outcome (Resaleable/Reformulatable/Scrap). Reformulation creates linked production batch with new SKU.
- **Freight Costs**: Freight/loading/unloading vouchers raised similar to other modules; payment approvals follow finance workflow.
- **Stock Update**: Based on QC outcome, inventory adjusted (positive adjustments require approvals). Debit note auto-calculated with override + remarks.

## 6. Integration & Automation Considerations
- **Zoho Sign-in**: Use Zoho Creator portals for user access; map portal users to stakeholder roles.
- **AI PO Parser**: Integrate via REST API (custom function) to parse uploaded PDFs; provide manual override interface.
- **Face Recognition**: External API triggered on attendance capture; store only match score and reference photo path.
- **Bank Statement Parsing**: Custom parser for CSV/PDF (converted via third-party) to extract transactions, match with invoices using amount/date/reference heuristics.
- **Tally Export**: Generate CSV/PDF exports aligning with Tally import structure for GST reconciliation and ledger posting.
- **Digital Signatures**: Use Zoho Sign or third-party for QC reports; store signed document.
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS/Zoho Cliq notifications for approvals, overdue items, reminder triggers (freight payments, counter sample returns, job work overdue).
- **IoT Readiness**: No immediate machinery IoT integration; leave extensibility hooks (webhooks/API placeholders) for future phases once monitoring scope is finalised.
- **Device Optimisation**: Creator pages and mobile apps configured per role—warehouse, QC, logistics, and attendance stakeholders receive mobile-responsive pages while HO dashboards stay desktop-centric.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap (Suggested Phases)
1. **Foundation & Masters**: Configure companies, warehouses, roles, products/services, tax masters, templates, branding console.
2. **Purchase & Inventory**: Build PR → PO → Receipt → QC → Payment flows, freight advice, stock ledger.
3. **Sales & Dispatch**: Customer PO upload, SO approval, DC, invoice verification, receivables.
4. **Production & QC**: BOM planner, work orders, QC templates, wage integration.
5. **Logistics (Transfers, Job Work)**: Stock transfer, inter-warehouse shifting, job work handling.
6. **Finance Enhancements**: Ledger, payments/receipts, bank reconciliation, petty cash, GST/TDS/TCS reporting.
7. **Attendance & HR**: Staff onboarding, attendance logging, leaves, overtime wages.
8. **Advanced Reporting & Automation**: Dashboards, alerts, analytics, AI parser tuning.

## 8. Governance & Admin Controls
- **Template Management**: IT Admin maintains revision history with effective dates. Workflows ensure in-use batches reference active revision.
- **Audit Trails**: Enable audit logging for approvals, manual overrides (e.g., invoice adjustments, debit note overrides).
- **Compliance Checks**: Validate GST/TDS/TCS calculations before posting financial transactions; maintain separation of product price vs tax for variance checks.
- **Data Retention**: Attendance photos auto-purged after 7 days; QC counter samples tracked for 1–2 years; financial documents retained per statutory requirement.
- **Exception Handling**: Provide workflows for manual interventions (e.g., skip RFQ, override invoice amount) with mandatory remarks and approvals.

## 9. Decision Log
- **AI Services**: OpenAI API selected for both customer PO parsing and face recognition integrations.
- **High-Value Thresholds**: Stock adjustments above ₹25,000 escalate to Finance/Office Manager; freight payment reminders trigger on each instalment due date.
- **Bank Statement Frequency**: Finance uploads bank statements daily to maximise reconciliation automation accuracy.
- **IoT Roadmap**: Machinery IoT integration deferred to future phases; keep architecture extensible for later adoption.
- **Interface Strategy**: Enable both Zoho Creator desktop pages (HO users) and mobile-optimised pages (warehouse, QC, logistics, attendance stakeholders).

This blueprint serves as the authoritative reference for building the Zoho Creator ERP. Each module section can be expanded into detailed form/workflow specifications during configuration sprints. IT Admin and module owners should review jointly to validate data structures and approval matrices before development.
