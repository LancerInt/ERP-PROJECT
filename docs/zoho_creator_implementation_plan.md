## Cross-Phase Enablers
- **Testing Strategy**: Adopt sprint-based UAT cycles per phase with regression checklists and sample data sets.
- **Data Migration**: Stage legacy uploads (vendors, customers, products, price lists, opening stock) at the start of each relevant phase using CSV/XLSX templates.
- **Documentation & Training**: Maintain module-specific SOPs, in-app help, and release notes; run refresher sessions for new warehouses or role changes.
- **Governance**: Establish steering committee reviews at phase gates to confirm readiness, adoption metrics, and risk mitigations.

Timelines are indicative; adjust durations based on resource availability, complexity of integrations, and organisational readiness.
