# ERP Project Sandbox

This repository provides scaffolding assets for configuring our Zoho Creator based ERP.

## Contents

- `data/master_forms.json` — canonical master data form specification with field-level metadata for every Zoho Creator master module (companies, warehouses, products, vendors, customers, logistics, finance, HR, QC, production, integrations, and more).
- `data/zia_master_form_prompts.md` — sequential Zoho Zia prompts for building all master/reference forms.
- `data/zia_phase1_form_prompts.md` — Zoho Zia prompts covering every Phase 1 procure-to-pay and inventory transaction form.

## Usage

1. Review `data/master_forms.json` to understand required forms, fields, lookups, and dropdown choices.
2. Create the forms inside Zoho Creator manually or via Deluge scripts, mirroring the field definitions.
3. Extend or localise dropdown values and validation rules in Creator after import as necessary.

> **Tip:** The JSON file also defines reusable choice lists (for example, Indian states) that can be copied into Creator picklists.
