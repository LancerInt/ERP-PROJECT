# ERP Project Sandbox

This repository provides scaffolding assets for configuring our Zoho Creator based ERP.

## Contents

- `data/zia_master_form_prompts.md` — sequential Zoho Zia prompts for building all master/reference forms.
- `data/zia_phase1_form_prompts.md` — Zoho Zia prompts covering every Phase 1 procure-to-pay and inventory transaction form.
- `forms/ds/erp_creator_suite.ds` — single ready-to-import Deluge (`.ds`) app script that provisions every master and transactional form defined in the data model.
- `scripts/render_data_models_pdf.sh` — Pandoc helper that produces a professionally formatted PDF of the detailed data model catalogue.
- `scripts/generate_creator_ds_forms.py` — converter that regenerates the `.ds` form library straight from the data model catalogue.

## Usage

1. Use the master-form or Phase 1 Zia prompt packs in `data/` to seed the Creator forms quickly.
2. Refer to `docs/data-models/zoho_creator_data_models.md` for the authoritative field definitions, link-name mappings, and validation guidance.
3. Import `forms/ds/erp_creator_suite.ds` into Zoho Creator to deploy the entire form library in one step.
4. Run `scripts/generate_creator_ds_forms.py` whenever the data model changes to refresh the consolidated `.ds` app script, and `scripts/render_data_models_pdf.sh` (after installing Pandoc and a PDF engine) when you need an offline reference copy of the data model catalogue.

> **Tip:** Supply `PDF_ENGINE=wkhtmltopdf` (or another installed engine) when your environment lacks LaTeX tooling.
